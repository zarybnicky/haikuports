SUMMARY="Vim is highly configurable text editor."
DESCRIPTION="
Vim is a highly configurable text editor built to enable efficient text \
editing. It is an improved version of the vi editor distributed with most UNIX \
systems.
Vim is often called a \"programmer's editor,\" and so useful for programming \
that many consider it an entire IDE. It's not just for programmers, though. \
Vim is perfect for all kinds of text editing, from composing email to editing \
configuration files.
Despite this, Vim can be configured to work in a very \
simple (Notepad-like) way, called evim or Easy Vim.
